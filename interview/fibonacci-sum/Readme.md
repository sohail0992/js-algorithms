Write a program that
prints 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ... up to some +ve integer N
the natural number series, but
with all numbers that also show up in the fibonacci series replaced with -1
so a refresher on fibonacci if you need it:
the fibonacci series starts with the numbers 0 and 1
and then you can generate all subsequent numbers by summing the previous 2 numbers in the series
so the series goes 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 .. etc
so in your program, it should print the natural number series, but any number that also occurs in the fibonacci series needs to be replaced with -1
the output should look like -1 -1 -1 4 -1 6 7 -1 9 10 ... etc

## Example

```
Given N = 7, arr will be [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] and output  [-1, -1, -1, 4, -1, 6, 7]
```
